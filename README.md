# Four-Legged Friend Adoption Agency
This is a personal website that I decided to created which I had made Ux design templates a year ago. I wanted to showcase my overall skills as a designer and a developer.

## Summary
Four-Legged Friend is an adoption agency of homeless animals that are in need of a loving home. In the website there is a picture of a dog poping out of the scene. As you scroll down there is a little description about the company. Puppies, kittens, dogs, and cats will be shown for visuals but also showcase who are available to adopt. Although there will be a serious message in the website, the design are more vibrant with abstract shapes to grab the customer's assistance.


### Software used:
Visual Studio Code

### What I learn:
I learned how to make a hamburger navigation which I implemented in other projects.
How create pop up effects which I implemented in other projects.
Parallax effect which I implemented to my portfolio/resume.

#### Challenges to improve on:
1. Overlays ontop of picture, while also having content on top of it..  
2. Flexbox 

#### Random Unexpected Challenges:
1. Hamburger bar   Adult animals section names and paragraphs were not functioning properly.
3. Contact link in the footer would not change in size to match the rest.
4. Special effects for navigation would not work.
5. White space on the right side of the website appeared in mobile and tablet device multiple times.

#### Solutions/solving the issue:
1. Dev Tools is a MUST, even when Global styles and Media queries has technical difficulties.


#### Weakness so far:
1.	flexbox is my weakness
